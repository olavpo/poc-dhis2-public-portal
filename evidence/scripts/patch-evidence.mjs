/**
 * Idempotent build-time optimisations applied to the installed Evidence template.
 * These are NOT environment workarounds — the build is stock prerendering. They are:
 *
 *   1. adapter-static `fallback: '200.html'` — a safety net so a route the prerender
 *      crawler didn't reach still resolves client-side instead of 404-ing.
 *   2. lazy DuckDB-WASM init — defer booting the ~6 MB (compressed) engine until the
 *      first client-side query, so baked pages (national, indicators) that only read
 *      prerendered .arrow results never download it.
 *
 * Patches the installed template so they survive the .evidence/template sync.
